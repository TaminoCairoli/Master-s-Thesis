The scripts (CombinePriors.py, final_Rot125_TiltInvert.py, final_Rot180.py and final_Rot55_TiltInvert.py) were written in the scope of my Master's Thesis. 
All scripts were written with the help of ChatGPT. They are executable from the commandline with python3.

The scripts (Relion2Warp.py and EulerAngles.py) were adapted from script templates provided by Huy Bui.
Adaptations to the scripts were done with ChatGPT. They are executable form the commandline with python3.
